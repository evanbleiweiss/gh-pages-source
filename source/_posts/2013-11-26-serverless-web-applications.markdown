## A thought experiement
The notion that there are:

 - Sufficient free CDNs hosting client side scripts
 - Creates a bevvy of "free" functionality in the form of OSS libraries / utils
 - The data is 'pretty much' out there
 - And it can be crawled / harvested / ingested
 - Data computation can be performed on the client side
 - And perhaps shared with other users of the site directly
 - Creating a Swarm effect, and improving performance

Persistence remains an issue, as does caching, but I wonder what the limitations are in terms of 'web-safe' problem domains that this could not tackle. (Obv not anything relying on very low latency, for example)
